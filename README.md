# Try It On Backend service

# NOTE:
    - There may be some configs that you need to add to your GIT in order for it to function properly

# Before you start:
    - Make sure to always branch off develop before attempting any tasks/stories 
        (checkout develop -> then type in the command: git checkout -b make_of_your_new_branch develop)
    - Keep the story moving through the Trello Board
    - Be specific on what you did in your commit (this is so that we can keep track of what is happening)
    - COMMIT OFTEN!! I usually get told to commit often when I am at work, and this is because we always need to keep track   of when and if the code breaks
